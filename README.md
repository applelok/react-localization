A little demo on react-localization with Create-react-app/ React-intl v5/ flatten.

Using [Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), 
[React-intl v5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) and [flatten](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatten) for localization.

Main focus: Demostrate keys under each language folder could be declared in object structure instead of key-value mapping.

## Run project
